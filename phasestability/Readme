1. Folders correspond to the following binary alloys

   (Cs,FA)PbI3
   (FA,MA)PbI3

2. Convexhull - data points on the convex hull for the binary alloys
3. fulldata - all the data points for the binary alloys
4. *.csv file naming - alloyname_temp.csv

   example:
   CsFA_T600.csv - enthalpy data for (Cs,FA)PbI3 alloy at T = 600 K

   Note: 
   For T = 300 K, two data sets are available labeled as T300_above and T300_below, depending on the choice of the reference (pure phase) crystal structure at 300 K. Please refer figure 3 in Energy. Envrion. Sci. 12 1341 2019 (DOI:10.1039/c8ee03051k)

5. Data format - {Composition, dE_mix (in eV/formula unit), T*dS_mix (eV/fu), dG_mix (eV/fu)}
